    "The uniform cut is bound to include repetitions. It must be chosen as small as possible to be sure not to include two movements within one window of time. Maybe a different window should be chosen for rapid movements vs. longer ones. To start with, we prefer to chose a window adapted to the fastest movements, i.e. the length of a step, following the example of this <a href='https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231212217_Step_Length_Estimation_Using_Handheld_Inertial_Sensors?enrichId=rgreq-423614f69f285922f33cc150bb687ef6-XXX&enrichSource=Y292ZXJQYWdlOzIzMTIxMjIxNztBUzo5OTU4MDk5MzYwNTY0NEAxNDAwNzUzMzY4MjM4&el=1_x_3&_esc=publicationCoverPdf'>step length estimation.</a>\n",
    "<p>\"These features are computed by dividing the data in windows of 256 samples, corresponding to 2.56 seconds, with a 50% overlap. The window size is selected to be small enough to catch any fast motionâ€™s change and large enough to include one complete gait cycle. In addition, a window size N=2^n allows the computation of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) used for the analysis in the frequency domain. It is worth mentioning that the proposed FFT analysis is applied on a window that is small enough to target real time applications since the induced lag is around half of the window size, namely 1.28 seconds.\"</p>"
